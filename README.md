# Source-Camera-Model-Identification-
Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach using Fusion Layer for Source Camera Model Identification based on Video Taken by Smartphone.

The fusion method (implementation) is borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/soheilb/multimodal_dictionary_learning">Soheil Bahrampour</a> codebase.

Forward and Backward function is defined in FusionLayer.m

One of our implementations of the model is in ConstrainedNetMultistreams.m
